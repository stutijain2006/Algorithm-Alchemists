# Trackify
An expense tracker application
This Flutter application is a comprehensive expense tracker that monitors all your credits and debits by analysing SMS notifications. It provides insightful statistical data by categorizing transactions into various categories, helping users effortlessly manage and track their finances.
We’ve crafted customised logos and a pleasing, easy to use aesthetic for different sections of the app, adding to its visual appeal. While the app is currently facing some Gradle build issues, we are confident that with a few adjustments, it can evolve into an exceptional personal finance tool—a pocket diary for tracking expenses with a sleek design and smooth user experience.
As first-year students participating in a hackathon for the very first time, building this application with limited knowledge of Flutter has been a very challenging but nevertheless rewarding experience. We are excited and eager to continue refining and improving it, aiming to make it even more powerful and user-friendly in the future.
